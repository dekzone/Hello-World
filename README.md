Howdy, 
This is the first GIT repository I have created. 
I have worked within svn repositories however, GIT I joined back in 2013 and never moved further with the 
process to create my own respository.
Now I have my own repository and this will move forward with keeping the ITAPPs team up to date 
with all the changes in the codes that are used and created within this team.
